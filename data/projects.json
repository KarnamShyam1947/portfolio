            "description" : "The Workers Safety Equipment Detection project uses AI and Machine Learning to ensure that workers are wearing the necessary safety equipment in hazardous environments. This system leverages computer vision techniques to analyze real-time video or images and detects whether workers are equipped with essential safety gear such as helmets, gloves, safety vests, and more. By using advanced object detection models, the solution enhances workplace safety, helps prevent accidents, and provides automated compliance checks. This technology can be integrated into construction sites, factories, or any other work environments where safety is critical.",
